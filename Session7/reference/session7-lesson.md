## 1. What this session is

Four sessions ago this course turned away from the model and went to work on the data, and it stayed there. Session 3 decided what to collect, Session 4 built the pipeline that turns collected bytes into admissible text, Session 5 arranged the clean pools into a mixture and a curriculum, and Session 6 compiled that recipe into an executable stream with a ledger behind it. That arc is finished. What comes out of Session 6 is a packed batch of integer token identifiers, and this session is where those integers finally meet the model.

The place we are standing was named precisely once before. Session 2 ended on the sentence that the tokenizer's job is complete the moment text has become a sequence of integers, and that the question of what vector each integer turns into belongs to a different component on the far side of a clean seam. This is that component, and this is that class. Session 2 also left an unpaid debt here in writing, which is the full treatment of Kronecker factorization, deferred at the time with the note that it is an embedding-side trick and belongs to the class on embeddings and model internals. That debt is the centre of today.

It is worth saying plainly that Session 6 closed by pointing forward at the distributed training loop, gradient accumulation and parallelism. That pointer was wrong against the calendar. Those belong to Sessions 10 through 13, and there is a reason the model's front and back doors come first. The two matrices that face the token vocabulary are the largest single tensors in the model, they are decided before any training system is designed around them, and at the vocabulary and width V5 is heading toward they are large enough that the decision changes what the rest of the architecture can afford.

Here is the number that makes the session necessary. The V4 BrahmicTokenizer carries a vocabulary of 131,072 tokens, and the model width that vocabulary was paired with is 8,096. A dense input embedding table at that shape holds

    131,072 x 8,096 = 1,061,158,912 parameters

which is a little over a billion parameters, occupying 2.12 GB in bf16, before a single attention head or feedforward block exists. If the output projection is untied it is a second matrix of the same size. This is the storage problem Session 2 set up and handed forward, and the whole of today is spent first making it visible and then designing a way out of it that we can defend.

*Widget: a view of the seam itself, with Session 6's packed batch on one side and the model's first objects on the other. Each field the dataloader carries — token ids, loss mask, position ids, ledger tags — is traced to the model object that consumes it and to what breaks when it is wrong. The point to leave with is that the tokenizer's contract ends at an integer, and everything in this session lives on the far side of that boundary.*

## 2. The lookup is a gather, not a matrix multiply

Almost every explanation of an embedding layer describes it as a matrix multiplication against a one-hot vector, and that description is mathematically true and operationally misleading. Nobody builds a 131,072-element one-hot vector and multiplies it by a billion-parameter matrix in order to retrieve one row. The operation that actually runs is a gather: the integer is an offset, the hardware reads the row at that offset, and the cost is a memory read rather than an arithmetic one. Holding the gather picture rather than the matrix-multiply picture is what makes the rest of this session's behaviour predictable instead of surprising.

The consequence that matters lives in the backward pass. When gradient flows back into an embedding layer it does not update the table. It updates the rows that appeared in this batch, and it leaves every other row untouched. The operation is a scatter-add, which accumulates one gradient contribution per occurrence of a token into that token's row and writes nothing anywhere else. A row that did not appear in this batch receives exactly zero gradient this step, and under a plain optimizer it does not move at all.

Now put a real batch against a real vocabulary. A global batch of 256 sequences at 8,192 tokens is 2,097,152 token positions, and it is tempting to conclude that a batch that large leaves most of the table untouched. It does not, and it is worth being precise here rather than reaching for the dramatic version. At that batch size nearly every row is gathered on nearly every step, because two million draws against a hundred and thirty-one thousand rows will find even quite rare tokens. Coverage is not the problem.

The asymmetry is in how much gradient each row receives, and there the numbers are severe. Natural language is Zipfian, so the most frequent token contributes on the order of a hundred thousand gradient terms to its own row in that single step, while a token far down the tail contributes one, or less than one on average. The scatter-add sums those contributions, so the effective step size applied to a row scales with how often its token appeared. Across a realistic vocabulary that spread runs to five or six orders of magnitude.

The embedding table is not one object that trains at one rate. It is a hundred and thirty-one thousand small objects whose effective learning rates are set by the corpus rather than by the optimizer, and the slow end of that range is where the low-resource languages live.

The picture does change at smaller batch sizes, and it is worth seeing both. At the microbatch a single GPU actually processes, coverage genuinely is sparse and the tail rows go many steps between visits, which is why gradient accumulation across a large global batch is doing more work for the embedding layer than it is for any other tensor in the model.

This is the mechanism underneath a claim Session 3 made from the data side and could not yet explain from the model side. When an English-tuned filter thins the Indic pools, the effect is not only that the model sees less Indic text. It is that the Indic rows of the embedding table receive gradient less often, so they stay closer to their random initialisation for longer, and a row near initialisation contributes noise to every sequence it appears in. Protection at the mixture level, which Session 5 built as the always-on lane, is protection at the gradient level for these specific rows.

*Widget: a gather and scatter-add lab. The left panel walks one optimizer step through three stages: the batch of ids arriving, the forward gather reading one row per token, and the backward scatter-add writing into exactly those rows, where a token that appeared four times contributes four terms summed into a single update rather than four separate ones. Rows the batch did not name receive zero and do not move. The right panel runs that same sampling for hundreds of steps and plots the total gradient each row has accumulated: the rows end up trained to wildly different degrees, and not because the optimizer treated them differently. It treated them identically. The corpus did not.*

## 3. What the table costs, and closing Session 2's loop

Session 2 ended its treatment of vocabulary size by reporting that the embedding table at the 131K setting is already larger than many complete models, and then handed the question forward rather than answering it. The answer is arithmetic, and it is worth doing carefully once, because the number that hurts is not the one most people quote.

The parameter count is the easy part. The input table is V x D. The output projection, which turns the final hidden state into a score for every token in the vocabulary, is another D x V. At V5's reference shape each of those is 1.06 billion parameters, and untied they are 2.12 billion together. Against a 120B mixture-of-experts model that is a small share of the total; against a 7B dense model it would be a third of everything. That is exactly why the same tokenizer decision reads as trivial at one scale and catastrophic at another.

The number that actually constrains the run is memory during training, and it is much larger than the parameter count suggests. A parameter being trained under AdamW in mixed precision is not two bytes. It is two bytes of bf16 weight, two bytes of bf16 gradient, four bytes of fp32 master copy, and four bytes each for the two optimizer moments: sixteen bytes per parameter. The input table alone therefore occupies

    1,061,158,912 x 16 bytes = 16.98 GB

of training state, and an untied pair occupies just under 34 GB. On an 80 GB accelerator that is two-fifths of the card consumed by the two matrices that do the least interesting work in the model: one is a lookup, the other a dot product against every row of that lookup.

This is the real reason the embedding decision is an architecture decision and not a detail. It is the pressure that makes every technique in the rest of this session worth the complexity it adds.

*Widget: a parameter and memory budget where you set vocabulary, width, depth, feedforward multiplier, tying and precision, and it computes the input table, the output head and the transformer stack as competing shares of the total. A second panel converts each into training memory with the full optimizer accounting and reports it against a card of the size you choose. Sweeping the width from 2,048 to 8,096 shows the embedding share collapsing while its absolute memory climbs.*

## 4. The tokenizer and the embedding are one design surface

Before we start compressing the table it is worth being clear that its size is not handed to us from outside. It is the product of a decision the cohort made in Session 2, and the two decisions have to be made together or they will fight.

The dial pulls in both directions at once. A smaller vocabulary means fewer rows and a smaller table, but it raises fertility, so the same document becomes more tokens, and every one of those extra tokens is paid for in attention compute at every layer for the whole of training and the whole of inference. A larger vocabulary lowers fertility and shortens sequences, but it grows the table and the output head in a straight line. Neither end is free and there is no neutral setting.

For an English-only model this is a mild optimisation. For an India-first model it is the whole problem, because fertility is not uniform across the languages we care about. Session 3 measured this directly: a tokenizer that splits Telugu into roughly three times as many tokens as it uses for the same meaning in English hands Telugu a third of the effective context and three times the inference bill, and no amount of extra vocabulary fixes that unless the extra slots are spent on the scripts that need them. The vocabulary is a budget, and its allocation across scripts is a sovereign decision, which is precisely what the BrahmicTokenizer retrofit was about.

The tokenizer decides how much attention compute each language costs. The embedding system decides how much parameter memory that vocabulary costs. Change either and you have changed the other's bill.

*Widget: a fertility and cost lab. Set a corpus mix and a vocabulary; the attention-side cost falls as vocabulary grows (fertility falls) while the parameter-side cost rises linearly. Their sum has a minimum, and the minimum moves with the corpus mix: English-only puts it near 53K, the V5 mix near 101K, an Indic-heavy mix past 113K. Fertility decays toward a floor of one token per word, so a language's reducible headroom is what extra vocabulary can buy — English has almost none, Tamil has a great deal. The direction of travel is the result; the absolute number is not.*

## 5. Weight tying

The cheapest available saving is to notice that we have two matrices of identical shape facing the same vocabulary, and to use one matrix for both jobs. Weight tying sets the output projection to the transpose of the input embedding, which removes an entire billion-parameter tensor and about 17 GB of training state at V5's reference shape. It has a respectable argument behind it beyond the saving: both matrices live in the same space, and tying them forces the geometry the model reads tokens with to be the geometry it predicts tokens with.

The argument against is that the two jobs are not the same job.

- At the input, the row has to be a good starting representation for a token about to be processed by the whole network, which rewards encoding what the token means.
- At the output, the row has to produce a score that separates this token from every other token that could plausibly come next, which rewards encoding what distinguishes it from its competitors.

Those two objectives agree for most of the vocabulary and disagree exactly where it matters: on the frequent function words whose meaning is thin but whose prediction is constant.

The empirical position is stable enough to state as a rule. Tying pays when the token-facing matrices are a large share of the model, because the saving is real and the regularisation helps a small model that would otherwise overfit them. It stops paying as the model grows, because the saving becomes a rounding error while the constraint on the geometry does not. GPT-2 tied and Gemma ties; Llama-2 at 7B does not. The threshold is not a magic number, it is the point where the embedding share of total parameters falls into the low single digits, and V5 is well past it.

*Widget: a weight-tying board showing the two token-facing matrices side by side, collapsing into one when tying is enabled, with parameter and training-memory saving computed live. A scale sweep runs the same tokenizer against model sizes from 500M to 120B and plots embedding share of total parameters, marking the band where the saving stops being worth the constraint. V5 sits well to the right of it.*

## 6. Factorized embeddings, the on-ramp

Tying halves the problem. Factorization attacks what is left, and the simplest form of it is worth meeting first because it makes the trade explicit before we reach for anything cleverer.

The observation is that the row a token is looked up as does not have to be as wide as the model. We can look the token up in a narrow table and then project the narrow vector up to the model width with a matrix shared by every token. The narrow table is V x r and the projection is r x D, so the parameter count becomes V*r + r*D in place of V*D. At V5's shape with a rank of 512 that is 67.1 million plus 4.1 million: about 71 million parameters in place of 1.06 billion, a reduction of roughly 93 percent. This is the scheme ALBERT used, and the arithmetic is as good as it looks.

The cost is a rank bottleneck, and it is not a soft cost. Whatever the projection does, the set of vectors the embedding layer can produce is confined to an r-dimensional subspace of the D-dimensional space, because every output is the same r x D matrix applied to some narrow vector. The layer has V rows but at most r directions. If r is generous the constraint is invisible; if r is aggressive the model is being asked to represent a hundred and thirty thousand distinct tokens inside a few hundred directions, and tokens start having to share.

This is the honest shape of every compression technique in this session. You are not getting the same table for fewer parameters. You are getting a structured table, and the question is always whether the structure you imposed happens to match the structure the data has.

*Widget: a factorized embedding builder with the parameter arithmetic on one side and the bottleneck on the other. A reference table is constructed with a known spectrum so the reconstruction error of a rank-r approximation is exact rather than estimated, and retained energy is plotted against rank alongside the parameter saving. The knee where saving is still large and error is still small is visible, and so is the region past it where each further parameter saved costs real capacity.*

## 7. Kronecker factorization

Now the technique Session 2 promised, and the one the lab released.

A dense table keeps one row per token. Kronecker embeddings do not keep rows at all. They build each token's row out of the token's own bytes. The whole idea is three steps, and none of them is complicated.

**Step one: read the bytes.** Every token is a piece of text, and every piece of text is a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. The token `the` is three bytes. Nothing is learned here.

**Step two: mark a grid.** Picture a grid with 256 rows, one for each possible byte value, and 32 columns, one for each byte position. For every byte in the token, mark the cell at (its value, its position). A three-byte token marks three cells. Flatten that grid and you have a vector of 256 x 32 = 8,192 numbers, almost all of them zero. That vector is the token's code. It is fixed, it is never trained, and it is identical every time.

Marking the cell for one value and one position is exactly a Kronecker product of two one-hot vectors, which is where the name comes from:

    kappa(b) = (1/sqrt(L)) * vec( sum over positions p of c[byte_p] (x) p[position_p] )

The 1/sqrt(L) divides by the square root of the token's byte length so short and long tokens come out at a comparable scale, and the result is then z-normalised.

**Step three: project.** One shared `Linear(8192, d_model)` turns that fixed code into the vector the model actually uses. That projection is the only thing in the entire input path that is learned.

Now the parameter count, which is the part that matters:

    8,192 x 8,096 = 66,322,432 parameters

against a dense table's 1,061,158,912. That is a 93.75% reduction. Now notice what is missing from that multiplication: the vocabulary size. There is no V in it anywhere. The input path costs the same whether the vocabulary holds thirty thousand tokens or five hundred thousand, because the grid has 256 rows and 32 columns no matter how many tokens you point at it.

**What you gain**

- Cost stops depending on vocabulary. Adding tokens is free on the input side, which turns Section 4's whole trade-off on its head.
- Unseen tokens still work. A token the model never trained on still has bytes, so it still gets a sensible code rather than an untrained random row.
- Similar spellings start out similar. `train`, `training` and `trainer` share most of their bytes, so they begin near each other instead of unrelated.

**What you pay**

- The layer needs the token text. It takes a tokenizer and keeps a byte buffer per token, so it reaches back across the seam Session 2 drew. That is a deliberate trade, not an accident, and it is why the constructor carries both `vocab_size` and `tokenizer`.
- The code is frozen by construction. The codec never learns anything. If two tokens produce the same code, no amount of training can pull them apart, and Section 8 is about exactly when that happens.

One clarification, because the same name is used for two different things. There is a separate family that factorises the table as A ⊗ B, two learned matrices whose Kronecker product has the table's shape. That is a real technique and you will meet it in the literature. It is not this one. Here the Kronecker product is taken between a byte value and a byte position, both factors are one-hot rather than learned, and the full table is never reconstructed at all.

*Widget: a Kronecker microscope. Type any token, in any script, and watch the three steps run: UTF-8 bytes read, each byte marking one cell in a 256-by-32 grid at its value and its position, the flattened grid through the single shared projection. The parameter count updates live, and sliding the vocabulary does nothing to it, which is the point. Try `training`, then `भारत`, then `తెలుగు`, and watch the byte count per character change from one to three.*

*Widget: a walkthrough of the released module, stepped line by line. Watch which lines create a buffer (fixed, never trained) and which line creates the single Parameter. The byte buffer and the codec table are sized by the vocabulary but hold no trainable weights at all; the projection holds all of them and is not sized by the vocabulary at any point. The forward pass is two lines.*

The last point in that widget is the architectural one worth keeping. The module's entire visible behaviour is that it takes `[B, T]` integers and returns `[B, T, D]` floats. Everything about how the row was manufactured is private to it. That is why a compression decision this aggressive can be made, measured, and reversed without touching attention, the feedforward blocks, the loss, or the dataloader.

## 8. The thirty-two byte budget

Look at the grid again. It has 32 columns, which means only the first 32 bytes of a token are ever seen. The code says so plainly:

    L = min(len(byte_seq), pos_dim)

Bytes past position 32 are dropped. For English that limit is generous, because ASCII spends one byte per character, so 32 bytes is 32 characters and hardly any token comes close.

For Indic scripts it is not generous at all. Devanagari, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali and their neighbours sit in a region of Unicode that UTF-8 encodes in three bytes per character. The same window now holds ten characters, not thirty-two.

It gets tighter still, and Session 2 already told us why. A conjunct such as क्ष is not one character to Unicode. It is three code points: क, the halant, and ष. At three bytes each, that single visual character costs nine of the thirty-two bytes. A word carrying three or four conjuncts has spent the entire budget before it has finished.

And the failure is silent. Two tokens that agree on their first 32 bytes produce exactly the same code, and therefore exactly the same embedding vector, permanently. The projection cannot separate them because it is never shown a difference. Nothing raises an error and nothing warns; the model simply cannot tell those two tokens apart, and it never will.

This is the sovereign risk in the technique, and unlike most such risks it is a number rather than an argument.

So the question for V5 is not whether Kronecker embeddings save memory. They plainly do. It is whether `pos_dim = 32` is the right window for the scripts we care about, and that is answered by measurement: take the V5 vocabulary, encode every token, and count the collisions per script. Raising `pos_dim` to 64 doubles D and doubles the projection, to roughly 133M parameters, which is still eight times smaller than a dense table. If the collision count says buy it, buy it. The assignment asks you to produce that count.

*Widget: a byte budget lab, encoding real words in your browser. Each bar shows how much of a word survives the window and how much is thrown away, with the limit drawn as a black line. Below it, two genuinely different Hindi words, अंतर्राष्ट्रीयकरण and अंतर्राष्ट्रीयता, collide at the shipped `pos_dim = 32`: identical codes, identical vectors, indistinguishable to the model forever. Widen the window to 48 and they separate. That is the whole decision, in one control.*

## 9. The V4 scar: a frozen input path meets a mixture shift

Session 5 reported an incident from the inside of the previous run and left it there as a warning about mixture transitions. A sudden increase in the Hindi share, arriving against embeddings that had been frozen, drove the gradient norm up by roughly one hundred and fifty times over a short stretch. Session 5 read that as a lesson about changing the blend too abruptly, and it is. Read from this side of the seam it is a lesson about something more specific, and the more specific version is the one that generalises.

The embedding layer is the only place in the model where the token distribution meets continuous computation. Every distributional fact about the corpus — which tokens are common, which scripts are present, what the mixture currently is — enters the model through that one adapter. When the mixture changes, the statistics arriving at that adapter change, and the natural response is for the adapter to move. If it is frozen it cannot, and the adjustment has to happen somewhere. It happens in the layers above, which now have to absorb a shifted input distribution using parameters tuned for the old one, and that shows up as large updates that propagate.

This is not a learning-rate problem and it does not have a learning-rate fix. It is an adaptation-boundary problem: we removed the degrees of freedom at the point where the change enters, and were surprised when the change came out somewhere else.

Kronecker embeddings sharpen this considerably, which is the part V4 did not anticipate. A dense table has a billion degrees of freedom with which to absorb a distributional change, and it can move the rows that need to move and leave the rest alone. A Kronecker input path has the projection and nothing else. The codec is fixed by construction and holds no parameters at all, so every token in the vocabulary adapts through one shared matrix or does not adapt. There is no way to adjust how Hindi is represented without touching every other token at the same time. A compressed input path is a less capable adapter by construction, which makes the case for keeping the projection trainable stronger, not weaker, than it is for a dense table.

Compressing the embedding and freezing it are two decisions that each look locally reasonable and are jointly dangerous.

The operational conclusions follow directly, and they are the ones V5 adopts. The projection and factors stay trainable. Freezing, if it happens at all, is scheduled and logged rather than left on from an experiment. Mixture transitions get the warmup band Session 5 already mandated, and the gradient norms of the layers immediately above the embedding are monitored as a leading indicator rather than the global norm, which averages the signal away. And the ledger Session 6 built acquires one more field.

    embedding_policy_id

behind which sits the embedding type, the `char_dim` and `pos_dim` that fixed the codec, the tokenizer hash the byte buffers were built from, the trainable or frozen state of the projection, the unfreeze schedule, the position policy and the tying decision. The tokenizer hash matters more here than anywhere else in the course: change the tokenizer and every token's bytes change, so every code changes, and the projection is now trained against a codec that no longer exists. Session 6 argued that a checkpoint without a data position is incomplete. The same argument applies here: a checkpoint that cannot say what its input path was doing cannot be compared against another one.

*Widget: a frozen input path lab that trains a real model in the browser. A small language model over a two-domain vocabulary is trained with genuine forward passes, real cross-entropy and hand-written gradient descent, on a stream whose mixture shifts partway through the run. Freeze the embedding and the loss and the gradient norm of the layer above both jump at the transition; leave it trainable and the same transition is absorbed. A warmup control spreads the shift and the spike shrinks.*

## 10. Position: the model reads a set

Everything so far has answered the first of the two questions the model asks about an incoming token: what the token is. The second question is where it is, and the reason it needs a separate answer is structural rather than incidental.

Attention, as Session 2 built it, computes a score between every pair of positions from their query and key vectors and mixes values according to those scores. Nothing in that computation refers to the order of the sequence. Permute the input tokens and every pairwise score permutes with them, and the output permutes correspondingly: the mechanism is equivariant to permutation, which is a precise way of saying it cannot tell "dog bites man" from "man bites dog".

The transformer does not read a sequence. It reads a set, and order has to be supplied to it deliberately.

Session 2's minor topic already demonstrated this rather than asserting it, by training two tiny models side by side on a task rigged so every sequence appeared once with each label under a swap of two tokens. The token-only model was pinned at chance, because the two cases were literally identical inputs to it. The token-plus-position model learned the rule. That experiment is the foundation this section builds on, and the question now is what the position signal should be made of.

## 11. The absolute table, and the wall at max_position

The simplest answer is the one that mirrors what we just built for tokens: keep a second table, indexed by position instead of by identifier, and add its row to the token's row before the stack sees either.

```python
token_embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
position_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_position, d_model)

x = token_embedding(token_ids) + position_embedding(torch.arange(T))
```

This is what GPT-2 did and it works. It is also, as a parameter block, small enough to ignore next to the vocabulary table, since `max_position` is thousands rather than hundreds of thousands. So the objection to it is not cost.

The objection is that it inherits the property from Section 2 that we spent that section learning to be careful about. A position table is gathered and scatter-added exactly like a token table, so row t learns only from steps in which some sequence had a token at position t. If the model is trained with a maximum position of 4,096, then rows 0 through 4,095 are trained and row 7,000 does not exist. Extend the context at inference and there is no row to fetch; allocate the rows in advance and never train them, and they sit at their random initialisation and inject noise at exactly the positions you extended the model to handle.

The table cannot extrapolate, and the reason is not subtle or fixable by better training. There is no signal in the parameters that connects row 4,095 to row 4,096, because they were only ever independent rows in a lookup table.

That is a hard wall, and it is the wall the entire modern positional-encoding literature exists to get past. The way past it is to stop storing position and start computing it, so that position enters through a function of t defined for every t rather than through a row that exists only for the values seen in training. The original Transformer's sinusoidal encoding was the first version of that idea. What the field converged on afterwards, and what V5 will actually use, is the subject of the next class.

*Widget: an absolute position table trained live in the browser on a task whose answer depends on where a token sits. Training runs on positions zero through seven with real gradients and the model learns the rule to near-perfect accuracy inside that range. A second panel evaluates the same trained model at positions eight through fifteen, where accuracy falls to chance, and a coverage strip shows why: those rows never appeared in a batch, so the scatter-add never wrote to them and they hold their initialisation. The cliff at the trained boundary is measured, not drawn.*

## 12. The families, and what Session 8 builds

There are broadly four places a position signal can be injected:

1. **Stored and added at the input.** The absolute learned table we just built and just watched fail.
2. **Computed and added at the input.** The sinusoidal scheme, which extrapolates in the weak sense that the function is defined everywhere, though a model trained only on short sequences has still never had to use the far part of the function.
3. **Applied inside attention to the queries and keys**, so the score between two positions depends on their offset rather than their absolute indices. This is where the rotary family lives and where the field has settled.
4. **Applied to the attention scores directly** as a distance-dependent bias, which is the ALiBi family.

The trade running across all four is between how much the model is told and how much it has to infer. A signal that is stored is maximally expressive within its trained range and useless outside it. A signal that is computed generalises by construction but constrains what can be represented.

That is the same trade this session made twice already, once when a dense table became a factorized one and once when a factorized table became a Kronecker one. It is not a coincidence: it is what happens every time structure is substituted for stored parameters.

Session 8 takes this apart properly. It builds rotary position embeddings and the scaling schemes that extend them, it covers the attention-side variants that change which pairs get computed at all, and it treats long-context extension as its own engineering problem rather than as a larger number in a config. Today's job was to hand it a model whose input representation is decided and whose positional wall is felt rather than described.

## 13. The V5 embedding decision

- **Vocabulary** stays in the 131K class inherited from the BrahmicTokenizer work, chosen against fertility across the target scripts and against the parameter arithmetic in Section 3 together, not against either alone.
- **Input path** is the released Kronecker byte codec plus a trainable projection, with a dense table as the control arm. The `pos_dim` window is chosen by measurement rather than by default, starting from the shipped value of 32.
- **The projection is trainable throughout.** The codec is already frozen by construction, so freezing the projection as well leaves the input path with no adaptive capacity at all. Freezing is a scheduled and logged decision, never a residue of an experiment.
- **Output head is untied**, because at V5's scale the saving from tying is small and the constraint on the geometry is not, and because a structured input path and a dense output head are not naturally the same object anyway.
- **The byte window is an architectural parameter**, not a default to inherit. Section 8 showed that 32 bytes is 32 English characters but only 10 Indic ones, so `pos_dim` is set by a collision count measured on the real V5 vocabulary, per script.
- **Position policy is deferred to Session 8** by design, with the absolute table ruled out for the long-context target on the evidence in Section 11.

All of it is written into the ledger under `embedding_policy_id`, so any checkpoint can answer what its input path was doing when it was written.

Every number above is a hypothesis. Session 5 established the standard the cohort holds itself to on data decisions, which is that a proportion is an opinion until a proxy run has tested it, and there is no reason an architecture decision should be held to a lower standard than a mixture decision. The byte window, the projection width and the tying decision all get proxy runs at the one-billion and three-billion scale before any of them is trusted at full scale.

## 14. The assignment

> This is an interesting one, and can help you and me to write a paper. This is the direction I am planning to write Kronecker Embedding V2 and these are the ideas. You can pick any of these and ponder, think, work with your agent, and suggest what you would do. I am stating the problems here, so you can work out your own solution. You somehow would need to prove your solution as well. For that you can ask your agent to write a small transformer model and train it. It will figure out itself, don't worry. Here are the problems (each are separate, don't try and mix them):

1. **Mathematical structure in embeddings.** What if embeddings can store mathematical structure as well. Say 9 — somehow it has stored the meaning of 9 (in absolute math terms), such that when we actually do 9 + 9, the mathematical meaning part of the embeddings is itself 18! When we do 9*9 it becomes 81! How much can we push? Can we describe whole mathematics and all mathematical operations using this? Of course we need some space for alphabets/words as well; for that we can use the 32 existing spaces, and add this new concept into new ones (that are appended).
2. **Multimodal Kronecker.** What is the natural extension of Kronecker, such that it can represent images and audio as well? Yes we'll need to do some preprocessing of image and audio patches as well, but how do we use this concept to represent all 3?
3. **Dynamic position budget.** Today Kronecker is limited to 32 positions for every word (even "apple" or "a"). That's a waste of space. What can we do? How can it be dynamic and not force us to crop a word (currently we cannot have a word of len more than 32)?
4. **Fourier alternative.** What is a REAL Fourier alternative of Kronecker? Why can't I represent each character like a Fourier wave, and just add them to make a word?
5. **Invertible Kronecker.** Kronecker is forward deterministic (same word always gives the same embedding). How do I make a reverse of this (same embedding gives the same Kronecker)? If we can do this, then we can get rid of the final head as well! Then we can have a vocab of 1M as well without any issues.

> So pick any of these problems and submit your solution! In solution do mention which problem you're solving and how are you proving that your solution will work. Need a good README to read (can be a webapp to show graphs, animations, etc; else boring README also works) and definitely a code that proves your work.
