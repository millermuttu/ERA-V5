Session 4: Data Cleaning and Deduplication
1. What this session is

Session 3 ended on an honest gallery of the defects our own data audit caught in the pipeline that nonetheless shipped a 120B model, and this session is where each of those defects becomes a stage we build correctly. The two sessions belong together. Session 3 was about strategy, about what data to collect, how much of it we need, and which data buys which capability, and this session is about the engineering that turns what we collected into something we can actually train on. The single idea to hold onto from the first minute is that raw data is not training data. A downloaded web page, an Indic web crawl, or a dump of instruction pairs is raw material, and it only becomes a training corpus after it has been extracted, normalized, filtered, deduplicated, scanned for contamination, and stamped with a record of where it came from. Doing all of that reproducibly, so that the same input always produces the same output, is the real work of this phase, and it is the work that decides the quality of the model more than any later architectural cleverness will.

We open where we closed. The gallery of what broke in V4 was not a confession for its own sake, it was the map of this session, because the reason a team that built a 120B model still had priority-zero defects in its data path is that there was no cleaning stage at all. There was no shared function to normalize text, no agreement on a single conversation format, no deduplication on the Indic crawl, and no manifest to catch a copy-pasted file size or a non-deterministic identifier. Each of those absences is a stage we are about to build, and by the end of the ninety minutes the pipeline will be a thing you can name end to end and run yourself.

2. The pipeline as a whole

Before we go inside any single stage it helps to see the whole pipeline at once, because the stages are not a menu to pick from, they are an ordered sequence where each one depends on the one before it. Raw bytes come in on the left, and clean tokens with a provenance record come out on the right, and in between a surprising fraction of the raw material is removed. Seeing that fraction fall is the fastest way to feel that cleaning is not a light touch on top of collection, it is a large and deliberate reduction that we design.

The full pipeline laid out as its stages, from extraction and normalization through language identification, quality filtering, deduplication, PII removal, and decontamination, to the manifest that records provenance. A surviving-token bar runs beneath the stages and collapses as you click forward, so you feel how much raw data never becomes training text, and each stage names what it removes and carries a callout to the exact V4 defect it fixes. The one rule that sits under everything is that cleaning happens before the content hash is computed, so the hash reflects the cleaned text rather than the dirty original.

The extraction stage that sits first, the unglamorous business of turning a raw web page into clean prose, is the one we already studied in Session 3, so we treat it as known here and spend our time on the stages that were missing from V4 entirely. The rest of this session walks the pipeline from normalization onward.

3. Normalizing the text

The first stage that V4 skipped, and the one that caused the most visible damage, is text normalization. This is a small function, no more than fifteen lines, that runs on every document before anything else touches it, and its job is to put the raw text into one canonical form. It normalizes Unicode so that a character which can be encoded more than one way always ends up encoded the same way, it strips the invisible control characters that carry no meaning and only produce garbage tokens, it unescapes HTML entities so that an ampersand code becomes an actual ampersand, and it collapses runs of whitespace. The reason this matters so much is that a byte-level tokenizer sees every one of those stray characters, and an uncleaned corpus quietly teaches the model to spend vocabulary on zero-width spaces and broken byte fragments.

There is one subtlety in this stage that is the whole reason we cannot hand the job to a generic English cleaner, and it is the heart of the sovereign thread at the character level. Some invisible characters are noise and some are meaning. A zero-width space, a byte-order mark, and a bidirectional override are noise and must go, but the zero-width non-joiner and the zero-width joiner are legitimate parts of Brahmic scripts and carry real linguistic information, so a cleaner that strips all invisible characters mangles Indic text while believing it is helping. Getting this distinction right is the difference between a cleaner built for these languages and one that was never designed with them in mind.

A dirty paragraph you can edit, carrying HTML entities, a replacement character, a zero-width space, a byte-order mark, a bidirectional override, a ghost conversation marker, a run of extra spaces, and a short Indic string that contains a legitimate joiner. Toggle each cleaning operation and watch the removed characters struck out while the legitimate Indic joiners are badged as kept, with a garbage-token counter falling toward zero and a red flag lighting whenever a literal special-token marker is present. The point that lands is that stripping every invisible character is wrong, and the careful pass that keeps the Indic joiners is right.

The damage this stage prevents is not hypothetical. Our own audit found forty-six garbage tokens sitting in the vocabulary, made of zero-width characters, HTML artifacts, broken byte fragments, and private-use characters, and it found real conversation markers leaking straight into the pretraining text, all of it traceable to the simple fact that no such function existed. It is worth saying plainly that the corpus underneath much of this was Dolma, which is a genuinely clean corpus at the document level, and it still carried this character-level dirt, because being clean at the level of whole documents is not the same as being clean at the level of individual characters.

4. The ghost-tag trap

One particular kind of dirt deserves its own section because it does damage that shows up much later and is hard to trace back. When conversation data is collected from many sources, each source tends to mark who is speaking in its own way, one using square-bracket markers, another using angle-bracket tags, another using instruction headers, and each of those markers is written into the text as ordinary characters. During pretraining the model sees those markers as nothing special, just more subwords to predict, and it learns them as if they were a real part of the language. Then during supervised fine-tuning we introduce the tokenizer's actual special tokens for the user and the assistant, and the model now holds two competing ideas of what a conversation looks like, the fake structure it absorbed in pretraining and the real structure we want it to use, and the two fight each other.

One short conversation shown in the four incompatible formats our real sources arrived in, with a pretraining path that tokenizes the literal markers into ordinary subwords and an SFT path that uses the real special tokens as single units. A unify button rewrites all four sources into one canonical special-token format and the ghost markers disappear, while a collision meter moves from two competing formats in red to one canonical format in green. Seeing the four formats collapse into one makes the root cause of the ghost tags obvious and shows why choosing a single format is a cleaning-time decision.

This is exactly the priority-zero finding from our audit, where four different sources arrived in four different conversation formats and none of them used the tokenizer's real special tokens, which is precisely why the audit later flagged ghost markers sitting inside the pretraining shards. The fix is a decision more than a technique, which is to settle on one canonical format with real special tokens and rewrite every source into it at ingestion.

5. Quality filtering

Once the text is clean at the character level we decide whether each document is worth keeping at all, and this is quality filtering. It runs in two layers. The first layer is a chain of simple heuristic rules that catch documents which are obviously broken, checking things like the average word length, the ratio of symbols to words, whether lines end in punctuation the way real prose does, how much of the document is duplicated lines, and whether enough ordinary stop-words are present for the text to be genuine language rather than a list or a spam wall. The second layer is a trained classifier that scores what survives for something closer to educational value, learned cheaply by having a large model label a sample and then training a light model to imitate those labels at scale, which is the recipe we met in Session 3.

A document run down a visible cascade of heuristic rules, each showing its threshold and a pass or fail, followed by a classifier gate that gives an educational-value score and a final keep or drop, with a corpus bar that shrinks and an average-quality meter that climbs as strictness rises. An English toggle and an Indic toggle sit at the top, and switching to the Indic document shows a perfectly good Telugu passage failing several rules that were tuned for English, tinted as a penalty, with a note pointing at the script-aware fix.

The reason we show the Indic case so prominently is that this stage is where filter bias does its quiet damage. A chain of rules and a classifier tuned on English will score much of the low-resource web as garbage, and it will do so to genuinely good text, which is the same effect that led our previous run to protect Indic data in an always-on channel rather than let the selector judge it. Filtering is not a neutral cleaning step, it is a decision about which languages the model will be able to speak, and we treat it that way.

6. Deduplication, the mechanism

Deduplication is the stage with the most surprising depth, because the naive picture of it, finding documents that are exactly identical and dropping the copies, misses almost all of the real duplication, which is documents that are nearly the same rather than exactly the same. The same article reposted with a different header, the same code file with one comment changed, the same page crawled twice with slightly different boilerplate, none of these are exact matches, and catching them is what near-duplicate detection is for. The method that does it is worth understanding as a mechanism rather than a library call, because it is elegant and because it is the exact stage our Indic crawl was missing.

The idea comes in three moves. First we break each document into overlapping short pieces, called shingles, so that a document becomes a set of these pieces, and the true similarity of two documents is how much their two sets overlap. Comparing sets directly is expensive, so the second move replaces each set with a small fixed-length signature built from minimum hash values, with the property that the chance two signatures agree in any given slot equals the true overlap of the sets, which means we can estimate similarity by comparing short signatures instead of whole documents. The third move, locality-sensitive hashing, splits those signatures into bands and only compares documents that match in at least one band, which lets us find the near-duplicates without comparing every document to every other document.

Two editable near-duplicate documents turned into shingle sets, with the true overlap computed and shown, then reduced to two short minimum-hash signatures drawn side by side with their matching slots highlighted so the estimated overlap visibly tracks the true one. Two sliders set the number of bands and the rows per band, the widget plots the resulting selection curve and marks the similarity threshold it implies, and a verdict tells you whether this pair would be caught as a duplicate at the current setting. Editing a document to be more or less similar moves every number live, so the machine becomes something you understand rather than trust.

Our previous Indic crawl had none of this, no deduplication at any level, which the audit flagged as both wasted compute and a memorization risk once the run reaches scale, and this widget is the mechanism that stage was missing.

7. Deduplication at scale

Understanding the mechanism is only half of it, because deduplication has a property that makes it a systems problem rather than a task each student can finish alone. Duplication is global. Two students cleaning two different shards can each dedup their own shard perfectly and still leave a document that appears in both, because neither of them ever saw the other's data. A corpus is only truly deduplicated when the whole of it is compared against the whole of it, and that is a single large job that has to run on one machine that can hold the index for the entire corpus in memory.

Several student shards each deduplicating locally so each one looks clean, and then a global merge that reveals the cross-shard duplicates every local pass missed, collapsing them and dropping the merged token count. A memory readout computes the index footprint from the number of documents and the signature size and shows why the job needs a large-memory machine, with a checkpoint-resumable indicator and a cross-shard overlap percentage. The moment the global pass finds duplicates that every local pass called clean is the moment the need for one owned machine becomes obvious.

This is why the course provisions a central dedup machine as a named and owned artifact rather than leaving deduplication to three hundred students working separately. It is a large-memory instance, checkpoint-resumable so it can pause and continue rather than restart, attached to the shared storage, with a single owner and a backup, and it runs a proof-of-concept pass partway through the course and a final pass before the corpus is locked. Local dedup is useful, but it does not produce a globally deduplicated corpus, and only the central pass does.

8. Language identification and validation

Two shorter stages remain before the corpus is ready, and both are places where V4 had small bugs with real downstream cost. The first is language identification. It is tempting to trust the folder a document came from, so that everything under a directory named for Assamese is treated as Assamese, but web-crawled data is mislabeled often enough that this assumption quietly pollutes the per-language pools, and a mislabeled document skews the very fertility numbers we use to size each language's budget. The fix is to detect the language of each document at runtime rather than trust its provenance path.

A set of documents each carrying a claimed language from its folder path, run through a detector that reports the language it actually finds and a confidence, including a clean English case, a clean Telugu case, a code-switched Hindi and English case that the detector splits, and a document sitting in the Assamese folder that is really Bengali, which lights up as a mismatch. A small panel shows the Telugu language-code bug from our own pipeline, where a two-character code was used in a place that expected a three-character one and only worked because a fallback happened to return the right value.

That Telugu case is worth dwelling on for a second, because it is the kind of bug that is most dangerous, the kind that works. It produced the right answer by accident through a fallback, which means nothing failed loudly and nobody noticed, and it is exactly the sort of silent near-miss that a validation stage and a fail-loud posture are meant to catch.

9. Removing personal information

The second short stage is the removal of personal information, which matters both for the people whose data would otherwise sit in the corpus and for the legal usability of the corpus itself. It runs in two layers much like quality filtering. A regex layer catches the structured identifiers that follow predictable patterns, the emails and phone numbers and network addresses, and a machine-learning layer catches the things that do not follow a fixed pattern, chiefly personal names. The interesting tension is that the second layer trades precision against recall, and that trade is sharper for Indic names, where a common name or a place name can be caught as personal information when it should not be.

A document containing emails, a phone number, a network address, and a few personal names including an Indic one. A regex layer masks the structured identifiers cleanly, a name-detection layer catches the names, and a false-positive control then shows an Indic name or common word being wrongly masked, with a precision-and-recall readout that moves as you make the scrubber more or less aggressive. Seeing the structured identifiers vanish cleanly and then seeing an Indic name wrongly caught makes the precision-recall tension concrete rather than abstract.

10. Keeping the evaluation honest

The last cleaning stage protects every number we will ever report, and it is the firewall between the data we train on and the benchmark material we use to judge ourselves. We met this discipline in Session 3 as a sourcing decision, where the held-out material is kept out of the pools from the very first day, and here it returns as a mechanism that runs inside the pipeline. We fingerprint the evaluation sets, we scan every shard for overlap against those fingerprints, and we remove any training document that carries a piece of a test set, and we plant canary strings so that if a leak happens later we can detect it.

The firewall between the evaluation sets and the training shards, with a scan that flags overlaps by fingerprint, a toggle that injects a contaminated shard so a benchmark score jumps dishonestly and then falls back when the shard is removed, and a canary-string demonstration for detecting a leak after the fact. This is the same widget we used in Session 3, and the reason it returns is that the discipline has two homes, a firewall at sourcing time and a scan at cleaning time, and both have to hold for the scores to mean anything.

11. Reproducibility and the manifest

Everything so far produces cleaner text, but a clean corpus is only trustworthy if we can say exactly where every part of it came from and reproduce it on demand, and that is the job of the last stage. Reproducibility means the pipeline is deterministic, so that the same input always gives the same output and the same identifiers, which is why we build identifiers from the content itself rather than from a running counter that changes between runs. Provenance means that every shard carries a manifest recording its source, its license, who contributed it, the exact cleaning script that produced it, a content hash, the token count, and the language breakdown, and that no shard enters the corpus without one.

A form that assembles one shard's manifest and emits the provenance JSON live, with the content hash computed in the browser from the shard's own text so it is reproducible, the cleaning-script hash filled from the selected script rather than typed by hand, and a license field that stamps the shard as blocked whenever it is unknown or unsafe or whenever a required field is missing. A determinism panel re-runs the same content and shows the identical hash and identifiers, set against the non-deterministic identifiers our own pipeline produced, so that provenance and reproducibility stop feeling like paperwork and become the thing that decides whether a shard is allowed into the corpus at all.

This manifest is not only internal hygiene. It is the datasheet we publish with the open corpus and the audit trail behind the paper, and it is also the concrete object the gating rule enforces, because a contribution that cannot produce a manifest for its data has not actually shipped clean data. The defects that a manifest would have caught in our previous run are exactly the ones the audit found, the copy-pasted file sizes, the identifiers that changed on every run, and the token counts estimated with a ratio that is wrong for Indic by several times.

12. Minor topic: the collection tracker and the dedup machine

The Major above builds the pipeline. The Minor continues the Data Collection thread from Session 3, because the collection work is now underway and the cohort needs to see it as a shared and measured effort rather than a private task. The first thing to look at together is the live cleaning-numbers tracker, which shows who has shipped how many clean tokens and which pools are still under-served, so that effort can move toward the gaps rather than pile up where the data is already plentiful. The second thing is the central dedup machine, introduced here as the real provisioned artifact it has to be, a single large-memory instance with one named owner and a backup, sized for the merged corpus and resumable across restarts, because the previous section showed why deduplication cannot be left to each student alone. The Minor's job is operational rather than conceptual, which is to make the collection effort visible and to name the person and the machine that will run the one global pass everything else depends on.

13. The assignment

Work with your agent, and find in total "how many strategies" are listed in this session. Then find a 10-100M dataset like this, and then apply these cleanups. Find interested datasets, specially from the Session 3 that you may have come across. Finally create a widget that talks about:

how many strategies were there, and what are they (describe)
what dataset was picked by you
what was cleaned, why and how
any other strategy or concern was cleaned up?
final statistics

Upload to Netlify and then share the link.

14. What this session commits us to

Three commitments carry forward from here. The first is that cleaning is treated as load-bearing engineering rather than housekeeping, so the pipeline stages we built today, normalization, format discipline, quality filtering, deduplication, language validation, PII removal, decontamination, and the manifest, are the standing definition of what turns collected data into training data, and every later session that trains or fine-tunes assumes the data underneath it went through them. The second is that reproducibility and provenance are not optional, so the same input gives the same output, every shard carries a manifest, and no shard enters the corpus without one, which is what lets the gating rule mean something and what lets the paper defend its own corpus. The third is that the sovereign thread runs all the way down to the character level, so a cleaner that would strip the legitimate joiners out of Brahmic scripts is as unacceptable as one that leaves garbage in, and protecting low-resource languages is a default of the pipeline rather than an afterthought.

Session 5 turns from cleaning the data to arranging it, which is the question of data mixtures and curriculum, of how much of each kind of data the model sees and in what order, because once we have clean and documented pools the next decision is how to blend them into the corpus the model actually trains on. The cleaning we built this week is what makes that blend trustworthy, since a mixture is only as honest as the provenance of the pools it draws from.

The one thing to carry from this session. Raw data is not training data until a reproducible pipeline has normalized it, filtered it for quality, deduplicated it globally rather than locally, scanned it for contamination, and stamped every shard with a manifest of where it came from, and the whole of that pipeline is the fix for the defects our own last run shipped without it. Cleaning is not the housekeeping before the real work, it is the engineering that decides the model.
